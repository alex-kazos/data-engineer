    "- **a.** *Data modeling* is the process of designing and structuring how data is stored, organized, and related within a system. It serves as a blueprint for how information flows and is accessed, ensuring consistency, integrity, and clarity. In analytics and data engineering, data modeling is crucial because it enables efficient querying, reliable reporting, scalable architectures, and easier maintenance, all of which are key for supporting business decisions and data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b.** Types of data models:\n",
    "    - **Conceptual model:** High-level representation that defines the main entities and their relationships, focusing on what data is important without concern for implementation details. Useful for communicating with stakeholders and establishing business requirements.\n",
    "    - **Logical model:** More detailed than the conceptual model, it defines tables, columns, keys, and relationships in a technology-agnostic way. It translates business requirements into a structured format, preparing for implementation.\n",
    "    - **Physical model:** The actual implementation of the logical model in a specific database system. It specifies data types, indexes, partitions, and physical storage details, optimizing for performance and constraints of the chosen technology.\n"

    "  - Designed for complex, read-heavy queries and aggregations on large volumes of data.  \n",
    "  - Supports business intelligence, reporting, and analytics.  \n",

    "- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):**  \n",
    "  - Optimized for high-speed, write-heavy operations like inserts, updates, and deletes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### b. Data Mart\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **data mart** is a focused subset of a data warehouse, tailored for a specific business line, department, or team (e.g., finance, marketing).  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### c. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slowly Changing Dimensions** refer to dimension tables where attribute values may change over time (e.g., a customer's address or job title).  \n",
    "- They matter because tracking historical changes accurately is crucial for reliable analytics and reporting.  \n",
    "- *Example:*  \n",
