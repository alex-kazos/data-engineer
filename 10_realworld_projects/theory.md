# Section 10: Real-World Projects

## Overview
Real-world projects bring together all data engineering concepts into practical, impactful solutions.

---

## 1. What Makes a Good Project?
- Solves a real data problem
- Clear requirements and measurable outcomes
- Uses best practices for code, data, and infra

## 2. Typical Project Workflow
- **Requirements:** Define goals, data sources, outputs
- **Design:** Plan architecture, tools, data models
- **Implementation:** Build ETL/ELT, pipelines, monitoring
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, data quality tests
- **Deployment:** Automate, document, hand off

## 3. Example Projects
- **ETL Pipeline:** Ingest, clean, enrich, load to warehouse
- **Data Lake Setup:** Store raw/processed data on S3/GCS
- **Batch vs Streaming:** Integrate Spark and Kafka
- **Workflow Automation:** Airflow/Prefect for daily jobs

## 4. Key Tools and Technologies
- Python, SQL, Pandas, Spark, Airflow, dbt, Docker, cloud platforms

## 5. Measuring Success
- KPIs: Data freshness, latency, error rates
- Monitor with dashboards, alerts

## 6. Documentation & Reproducibility
- README, code comments, diagrams
- Use version control, Docker, notebooks

## 7. Best Practices
- Start small, iterate
- Test and monitor everything
- Communicate with stakeholders
